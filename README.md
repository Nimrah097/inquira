<h2 align="center">Inquira </h2>
Inquira is an AI-powered web app that lets users ask questions about input text using natural language. .

Features

REST API to process user questions

Langchain.js for question-answering over custom text

Tailwind CSS for a responsive UI

TypeScript with strict typing for reliability

Splash screen on load with redirect logic

Hosted on Replit + GitHub for easy access


How It Works:

Users start on the splash.html page (animated intro).

After 3 seconds, it redirects to test.html.

Users input their text and question.

A POST request is sent to the /ask REST endpoint.

Langchain processes the query using a Hugging Face.

The answer is returned and displayed on the frontend.
