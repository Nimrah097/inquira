# Inquira

Inquira is an AI-powered web app that lets users ask questions about input text using natural language.

---

## Features

- REST API to process user questions  
- Langchain.js for question-answering over custom text  
- Tailwind CSS for a responsive UI  
- TypeScript with strict typing for reliability  
- Splash screen on load with redirect logic  
- Hosted on Replit + GitHub for easy access

---

## How It Works

1. Users start on the `splash.html` page (animated intro).  
2. After 3 seconds, it redirects to `test.html`.  
3. Users input their text and question.  
4. A `POST` request is sent to the `/ask` REST endpoint.  
5. Langchain processes the query using a Hugging Face model.  
6. The answer is returned and displayed on the frontend.
